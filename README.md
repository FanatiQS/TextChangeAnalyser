# TextChangeAnalyser
Analyses and displays the changes between two versions of a text document

This small tool analyses the differences between two versions of a document and displays what has been removed and what has been added from one version to the other. It utilises Quills delta format behind the scenes.

## Usage
Download the index.html file and open it in a browser. Since it uses Quill as a library, you need an internet connection. Then just insert the two versions of your document into the two text editors and press the "Analyse" button. A new text editor will appear with red and/or green markings. The red markings are pieces of text that has been removed between the older version and the newer, while the green markings are text pieces that has been added.
